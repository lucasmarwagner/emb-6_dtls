    \brief  Hardware dependent initialization header file for AT86RF212.

    \details For adaptation to another MAC/PHY layer at least 4 functions have
            to be implemented in accordance to \ref netstack_interface definition. Also
            after copying frame into the internal buffer and returning from the
            interrupt service routine \ref netstack_lowMac.input() should be called.
            See _rf212_callback() and ISR(INT5_vect) functions.
